# Orders To Print
•	Built a program that places product images from Magento orders onto the canvas in the most space-efficient way, reducing printing paper consumption by 15% and designer workload by half compared to the previous year

# Parts
Consists of three parts:
•	Site that proccessing images from orders ( this part is half-confidential :( )
•	Photoshop plugin - to put all images onto the canvas
•	Clo3D plugin - to make 3d products

# Use

### Site - just for looking for alghoritm ( you will not be able to run it :( )

### Photoshop just open plugin app

### Run main.py code in clo3d python tab
